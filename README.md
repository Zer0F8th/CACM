## Synopsis

CACM (CIP Asset Configuration Manager) is a cybersecurity and compliance tool built to support NERC CIP-010-4, a standard that remains one of the most frequently violated across power utilities. Existing baseline tools can collect configuration evidence from typical IT systems, but they often struggle in OT environments—especially with hardened vendor appliances that don’t allow agent-based or intrusive data collection. CACM addresses this gap by collecting baseline configuration evidence from Windows and Linux systems while also supporting these constrained OT devices through minimally invasive signature and telemetry collection tailored to each device class. Using these baselines, CACM enables ongoing detection of drift, unauthorized changes, and anomalous behavior over time, strengthening both compliance evidence and operational security.
